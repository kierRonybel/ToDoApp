To do application for IT Americano Exam

Hi, this is Kier Ronybel Berdin, and this is my simple to-do app for the examination.


I use React Native for this exam with Redux State management integration. I started coding this exam late because we have an emergency here in our house, so I can't start immediately. For the design, I keep it simple because I don't have enough time to make it more beautiful, but all the logic in the given exam is here. This is the given task that is finished; please see below:


1. Add and view tasks
2. Delete a task.
3. Complete a task.
4. Edit and update a task.
5. View tasks sorted by name.
6. View the number of total and completed tasks.


I will provide a sample APK for you to install on your Android devices, and I will also upload it to GitHub for you to see the source code of my exam.


Thank you!
